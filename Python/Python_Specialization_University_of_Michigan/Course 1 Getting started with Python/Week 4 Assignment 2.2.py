# Convert elevator floors
inp = input('Europe floor? : ')
# This input function prints something. Then it waits for you to input a value.
# After you input a value, it assigns it into the variable as a string.

usf = int(inp) + 1
# You use the int function, which is a built in function to convert 
# the string value to an integer value

print('US floor', usf)
# Then it prints the string and the new integer value of the usf variable

# Output
# Europe floor? : 3
# US floor 4
