\section{Introduction}

Hello! My name is Chowdhury Amir Abdullah and this is my first \LaTeX\ document.

If you leave a line gap in between two lines, it will create a hard return/enter. (Start a new paragraph). Like this paragraph here. 

However, if you want to have a soft return, then at the end of your line, you type two backslashes. \\
A rectangle has side lengths of $(x +1)$ and $(x+3)$. \\
The equation ${A(x) = l . b}$ gives us the area of the rectangle. Because we have used a single dollar sign before and after the equation, the equation will be displayed within the paragraph.\\
The equation $${A(x) = x^2 +4x+3}$$ however, gives the area of a conic section. Because we have used two dollar sign before and after the equation, the equation will be given a separate line.
